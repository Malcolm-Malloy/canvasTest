# canvasTest
Learning and experimenting with the fundamentals of the canvas element.

The initial upload includes the following Javascript/Canvas exercises

  1) rectCanvas.js - Testing how to draw rectangular objects ontop of each other using coordinates
  2) linesCirclesCanvas.js - Testing how to draw lines and circles
  3) curvesCanvas.js - Using curves to draw a picture of a flower
  
My first update of these tests completes the curvesCanvas.js and also adds

  1) textCanvas.js - Adding text to the canvas element (Note: CSS padding and margin do not affect the position of this coordinate based text)
